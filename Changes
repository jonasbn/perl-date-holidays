1.20 2020-04-21 Bug fix release, update recommended

- A bug was introduced with the release of 1.19, the bug had been lurking since just after the release of 1.18. The bug did not show itself unless adaptees where installed and I tested release 1.19 on a branch new Perlbrew installation, so the bug was not demonstrated.

- Added adapter for:
    Date::Holidays::UA added to the distribution thanks to Denis Boyun

    Ref: https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-date-holidays/pull/38

  Ref: https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-date-holidays/issues/18

- Changed the structure returned from Date::Holidays::DE from 
  a reference to an array to a reference to a hash, which is 
  easier to work with and seems to be the defacto standard

  This is all done in the adapter.

  Ref: https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-date-holidays/issues/29


1.14 2018-06-14 Feature release, update recommended

1.10 2018-05-31 Feature release, update recommended

- Added adapter for:
    Date::Holidays::NZ the distribution has been supported for some time, 
    but the latest changes revealed a sub-optimal integration. Support 
    for regions was also added

    Ref: https://github.com/jonasbn/Date-Holidays/issues/22


1.09 2018-05-30 Bug fix release, update not required

- Based on issue #21 several issues with the test suite was spotted
  and corrected, at the same time there was created issues for 
  implementation of adapters for SK and NZ. An issue with ES was also 
  created since this distribution seems to rely on Date::Holidays, 
  which does not seem to make sense.

  Ref: https://github.com/jonasbn/Date-Holidays/issues/21


1.08 2018-05-28 Feature release, update recommended

- Added adapter for:
    Date::Holidays::USFederal (US) in response to request from

- Aligned all version numbers

- Added t/kwalitee.t Test::Kwalitee test

- Added t/changes.t Test::CPAN::Changes test


0.15 2007.03.13 maintenance release, update not required

- Added t/perlcriticrc

- Updated t/critic.t to more contemporary version


0.14 2007.03.12 maintenance release, update not required

  Added the following (again) to MANIFEST as a result of the Kwalitee test:
    t/pod.t
    t/pod-coverage.t

  These had been removed from the distribution, but the kwalitee
  metrics likes them so, they are however not run as part of the
  normal test suite unless $TEST_POD is set in your environment.


0.13 2007.03.07 maintenance release, update not required

- Fixed b0rken tests
    t/new.t did not have a SKIP section
    t/datetime.t did not have a SKIP section


0.12 2007.03.05 maintenance release, update not required

- Increased the Perl::Critic severity to 5

- Exchanged Readonly for good old constants, one less dependency,
  should make the failing tests go away


0.11 2007.02.25 maintenance release, update not required

- Added missing requirement to Build.PL Readonly
  Based on tests reports from CPAN testers

  Thanks david at cantrell.org.uk

  I thought Readonly was core, but according to Module::CoreList this
  is not the case, so this has been corrected now

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part
  of the normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is
  set.

  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things. So they have been
  removed from MANIFEST.SKIP so they are now a part of the distribution.


0.10 2007.02.22 feature release, update not required

- Updated and corrected POD in Date::Holidays

- Updated and corrected POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter

- Added $VERSION to all exception classes
  (Date::Holidays::Exception::*), I and who just file an RT ticket on
  the same issue for another distribution

  oh the sweet nemesis :)

- Updated POD in all exception classes (Date::Holidays::Exception::*)

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::AU

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::GB

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::PT

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::NO

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::DK

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::FR

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::DE

- Updated POD in Date::Holidays::Adapter::JP

- Added new adapter for Date::Holidays::Adapter::ES
  lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/ES.pm

- Added use of exceptions instead of carp in Date::Holidays::Adapter,
  this however produces issues with adhering to Perl::Critics
  recommendation on explicit returns. Be aware that return with in
  Error's try-catch block returns from a sub, so you have to have a
  return outside the block.

  Perl::Critic is happy and I am happy

  Updated version to 0.02 for Date::Holidays::Adapter


0.09 2007.02.21 feature release update recommended

- Added no_indexing of t/ directory to Build.PL

- Updated README with pod2text appending of Date::Holidays POD

- Code cleaned a bit, much work still to be done

- Wrote some better DIAGNOSTICS and added 3 more Exceptions
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/InvalidCountryCodep.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/NoCountrySpecified.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/UnsupportedMethod.pm

- Added a few tests adapters for some of the tests dating before the
  refactoring (all tests now pass):
    t/lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/NOPOLY.t
    t/lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/OOP.t

- Renamed _loader in Date::Holidays to _fetch and _load, see also the
  similar methods in Date::Holidays::Adapter

    _loader.t obsolete and removed

- Introduced use of Error (Exceptions) for better diagnostics:
    Date/Holidays/Exception/AdapterInitialization.pm
    Date/Holidays/Exception/AdapterLoad.pm
    Date/Holidays/Exception/SuperAdapterLoad.pm

- Refactored the whole thing to a variation of an object adapter
  pattern, introduced:

    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/AU.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/DE.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/DK.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/FR.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/GB.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/JP.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/NO.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/PT.pm

  tests are located in t/Adapter:
    _fetch.t
    _load.t
    new.t

- Set severity to 3 for Test::Perl::Critic test
  ran code through perltidy to remove hard tabs

- Set severity to 4 for Test::Perl::Critic test
  added use warnings statement

- Changed the constructor to no longer be able to initialize a shallow
  object. If you want to make use of Date::Holidays ability to check
  all countries for a given holiday please, use it using full namespace.
  POD updated correspondingly.

- Addressed issue with method calling problems, OOP vs. Procedural vs.
  the weird mix I personally had boiled up, thanks to Florian Merges
  for reporting this.

  This has resulted in a minor cleanup and again I can see that the
  current architecture is not optimal, I am planning a major rewrite,
  to eliminate the problems of handling new classes introduced in the
  Date::Holidays::* namespace.

  I am not an authority of any kind, I just attempt to get things to
  play along nicely.

  New files introduced:
    t/NOPOLY.t
    t/OOP.t
    t/SUPERED.t
    t/ABSTRACTED.t
    t/PRODUCERAL.t
    t/new.t

  and the test classes (in t/lib/Date/Holidays):
    ABSTRACTED.pm
    NOPOLY.pm
    OOP.pm
    PROCUDERAL.pm
    SUPERED.pm

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP with more contemporary version

- Added t/critic.t, Test::Perl::Critic test, currently at severity 5.
  In addition to this I changed the 'return undef's scattered all over
  the code to simple return statements.

- Added t/kwalitee.t, Test::Kwalitee test, diabled check for symlinks
  since it reacted on symlinked .releaserc in directory, which however
  is NOT in the distribution even though it thinks so

  Added the following as a result of the Kwalitee test:
    t/pod.t
    t/pod-coverage.t

- Added use of Module::Load to Build.PL and to own _loader routine in
  Date::Holidays. I also added:
    t/_loader.t to isolate the actual test


0.08 2006.09.06 Bug fix release, update recommended

- Added RT request #21089, helper scripts not part of distribution, but
  mentioned in the autogenerated Makefile.PL

  Renamed bin/ directory to scripts/


0.07 2006.08.02 bug fix release, update recommended

- Removed bin/ directory from distribution (it is development purpose
  only anyway)

- Removed t/pod.t (and prerequisites in Build.PL) this test can be
  performed by Module::Build

- Removed t/pod-coverage.t (and prerequisites in Build.PL) this test
  can be performed by Module::Build

- Updated TODO with new point

- Changed way Makefile.PL is generated from 'passthrough' to
 'traditional', I kind of like the way it is done in Workflow, so I
  adapted this

- Fixed a bug in program flow concerning Date::Holidays::DE

- Fixed a test holding a wrong number of tests to be skipped

- Updated POD, added Date::Holidays::CN to SEE ALSO section (no work
  done to implement this at this time

- Updated POD with TEST COVERAGE section, planning next release to be a
  maintenance release focused on test coverage

  Also in an attempt to address:
  http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/276637


0.06 2005.12.17 Feature release, update recommended

- Moved build requirements to special section in Build.PL

- Added AU and NZ to bin/test_date-holidays.t

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP with:
    - Komodo project file
    - Module::Build parameters mentioned in Module::Signature

- Signed module using Module::Signature, added:
    - t/0-signature.t
    - SIGNATURE

- Parameter 'state' also added for holidays method, have sent patch to
  David Dick author of Date::Holidays::AU offering a more flexible API.

- Added some more POD on developing in the Date::Holidays::* namespace

- Date::Holidays::AU have been updated to 0.03, meaning that the exception
  implemented in 0.05 could be removed, it was however changed to accomodate
  the state parameter implemented in Date::Holidays::AU.

- Exchanged manually built Makefile.PL for a Makefile.PL maintained by
  Module::Build


0.05 2005.12.09 bug fix release, update recommended

- Addressing failing test
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/262252

	So we have added yet another exception, this time for Date::Holidays::AU.

	The problem is that its method is_holiday, needs an additional parameter
	indicating the state, the holidays method in the same module defaults
	to VIC, so for know we are using this as our default state, this will need
	readdressing.


0.04 2005.10.22 maintenance release, update not required

- Changes to unit-tests, it was assumed that some of the Date::Holidays
  modules where installed, this is not always the case

  This was pointed out to me by shild on use.perl.org:
  http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=28993&cid=43889


0.03 2006.10.13 feature release, update recommended

- Small refactoring added new sub _check_countries

- Moved portuguese exception, Date::Holiday::PT has changed name to
  Date::Holidays::PT, but it has turned OOP.

- Implemented new parameter in is_holiday (countries). This method
  returns a list of country codes having the holiday specified as a
  holiday for the respective country (suggested by cog).

  So it has to be used in conjunction with the data parameters: year,
  month and day

  if given a subset of countries only these countries are tested and a
  hashref is returned pointing where the countries codes are the keys
  and the values indicate true or false for the date specified.

  The values are:

  - undef if the country has no module or the data could not be obtained
  - a name of the holiday if a holiday is present
  - an empty string if the a module was located but the day is not a
  holiday

- Updated INSTALL

- Removed Exporter from prerequisites

- Replaced use of ExtUtils::Makemake with Module::Build

- Added realnames to Changes file (this file)

- Added suggestion on improvements from cog (Jose Castro) to TODO


0.02 2004.05.31 feature release, update not required

- Indented code in POD after tip from RJBS (Ricardo Signes)

- 'jp' left out of the test suite for now

- Date::Holidays::NO added to test suite, courtesy of MRAMBERG (Marcus
  Ramberg)

- Added experimental subs using DateTime objects as suggested by BORUP
  (Christian Borup) (SEE: TODO)


0.01 200405.22

- Intial release
